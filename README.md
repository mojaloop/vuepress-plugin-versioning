# vuepres-plugin-versioning

> Forked from [https://github.com/tidev/docs-devkit](https://github.com/tidev/docs-devkit)

> The original package was not receiving updates, and we wanted to change some pretty core functionality, such as making the `default` branch the `latest`, instead of an older version of the docs.
